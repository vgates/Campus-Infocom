# Campus-Infocom
My first PHP project. The project was done as part of my mini project during B.Tech in 2008.

Campus Infocom is a campus management software which introduces an efficient, apt and easy way to track and trace the students. 
Campus Infocom is essentially designed to enable the staffs to access student details, both personnel and academic. It provides separate login to the principal, HOD, staff and also to the students. Students can view their attendance, internal mark, external mark and their profile. The staff can add, edit, delete and update the student details. Principal and HOD are also provided to access student details. 

## Why it is here?
Just wanted to maintain my first project in GitHub. Also I wanted to set an example to the beginners that we should not code like this. :)

10 years later when I see this code it gives me happiness and also I could laugh at the mistakes I made.
